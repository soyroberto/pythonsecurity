## Generative AI: Prompt Engineering Basics

**I created this Python code to monitor the creation of XLS files inside a folder. Files are deleted on the spot**


It a training I ran over at Coursera, very useful and insightful about how to properly PROMPT and ask the righ questions to AI services:
DeepSeek, Chatgpt among others.

The content was generated by IBM

I certainly recommend it as it bring very useful topics, insights and advise and it's a practical hands on training, ex:

**Explain the concept and relevance of prompt engineering in generative AI models**
**writing effective prompts**
**best practices for creating prompts and explore examples of impactful prompts.**
